  "instructions": "This AI is going to recieve a JSON file that has three objects: ID, sectorInfo and globalInfo. The sector info is going to have 576 elements, each composing values of plantHealth, waterAddAmount, and mineralHealth. The second object is going to have values for timeID, which the number of weeks,  temperature, precipitation, and waterAmount. The goal is to efficiently water each of the sectors so that they  do not dry out and die while also preserving water. The water added will be defined by the value: waterAddAmount. The waterAmount will refill every four iterations, and you will water the sectors every iteration. Make sure you have enough water to continue to water your plants indefinitely. You will receive another updated JSON file with the new plant and weather info, and you have to determine which sectors to water.",
